# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum. It covers fundamental Python programming concepts including conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How Python's `for` loop is different from C's
- How to use the `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- What is a function and how to use functions
- What does a function return if it doesn't use any `return` statement
- Scope of variables
- What is a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### Mandatory Tasks

**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
- Assign a random signed number to the variable `number` and print whether it is positive, negative, or zero

**1. The last digit**
- Print the last digit of a random number and determine if it's greater than 5, is 0, or less than 6 and not 0

**2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia**
- Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line

**3. When I was having that alphabet soup**
- Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding `q` and `e`

**4. Hexadecimal printing**
- Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal

**5. 00...99**
- Print numbers from 0 to 99

**6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials**
- Print all possible different combinations of two digits

**7. islower**
- Write a function that checks for lowercase character

**8. To uppercase**
- Write a function that prints a string in uppercase

**9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes**
- Write a function that prints the last digit of a number

**10. a + b**
- Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result

**11. a ^ b**
- Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value

**12. Fizz Buzz**
- Print numbers from 1 to 100 with Fizz for multiples of 3, Buzz for multiples of 5, and FizzBuzz for multiples of both
